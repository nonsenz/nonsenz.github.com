# bootrsapping a nice freebsd jail under freenas

## whats the problem?

since freenas 9.2.1 does not support native jail cloning (looks like 9.3 will: https://bugs.freenas.org/issues/5074) and it is not recommended to do it via warden in the background (http://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/what-is-the-recommended-way-to-clone-a-jail.21156/#post-122791), one has to manually setup the jail with the standard tools before doing anything else. here are the m default things to do:

## setting it up 

### create the jail

### enabling ports

### tools

zsh, vim, ...
